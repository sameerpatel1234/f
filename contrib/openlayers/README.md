#OpenLayers + mcmap#
This is a simple example of how you could start using mcmap with [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org).
OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles and markers loaded from any source. 
OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. 
OpenLayers is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the 2-clause BSD License (also known as the FreeBSD).


##Instructions##
This will work on Linux if you have ImageMagic and pngcrush installed.

* Make sure mcmap is in your path or edit render.sh
* $>./render.sh
* open mcmap.html in a web browser.
  The browser must support loading from local files or you have to put mcmap.html and the tiles folder that will be crated on a web server



##TODO##
* Make stuff use some sort of usable coordinate system and don't let openlayers guess it
